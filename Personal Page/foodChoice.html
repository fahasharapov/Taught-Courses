	<ol>
	<li>Eat a balanced diet. Include a healthy balance of nutrient-rich <br>
	carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, and roots like potatoes. This <br>
	will help make sure your body gets the right balance of the vital vitamins <br>
	and minerals it needs in order to keep you strong and healthy. The <br>
	recommended balance varies from diet plan to diet plan, and your ideal <br>
	balance may be a little different from someone else's. However, some common <br>
	options include: </li>
	</ol>

    <ul>
	<li>Eat a diet of 30% vegetables(dark colored <br>
	vegetables are better, such as spinach) 20%<br>

	such as pomegranates), 20% carbohydrates (starches <br>
	like wheat, rice and oats), 20% protein (which is <br>
	found in meat, beans, and legumes), and 10% dairy<br>
