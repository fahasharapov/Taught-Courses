We work best when we feel that our work in some small
way makes the world a better place for people to live
in. Our civilization runs on software. Improving software
and finding new uses for software are two of the ways an
individual can help improve the lives of many. Programming
plays an essential role in that. 


 MY FOOD CHOICE

Making Healthy Food Choices

    Eat a balanced diet. Include a healthy balance of nutrient-rich
    carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, and roots like potatoes. This
    will help make sure your body gets the right balance of the vital vitamins
    and minerals it needs in order to keep you strong and healthy. The
    recommended balance varies from diet plan to diet plan, and your ideal
    balance may be a little different from someone else's. However, some common
    options include:

    Eat a diet of 30% vegetables(dark colored
    vegetables are better, such as spinach) 20%
    fruit (eat the ones with more nutritional value,
    such as pomegranates), 20% carbohydrates (starches
    like wheat, rice and oats), 20% protein (which is
    found in meat, beans, and legumes), and 10% dairy
    products.
    Eating a diet of 80% carbohydrates such as fruits,
    vegetables, and starches like wheat, rice, and corn, 10%
    protein (which is found in meat, beans, and legumes),
    and 10% fats.
